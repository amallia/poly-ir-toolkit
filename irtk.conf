# Document collection format.

# The initial buffer size to use for uncompressing document collection files.

# Size of the memory pool for posting accumulation.
memory_pool_size = 268435456 # 4294967296

# Size of each memory pool block. Should be kept small to make the most use of memory.
# The smaller the size, the less memory we waste for very small lists,
# but the more overall pointer overhead we have since we have to store a pointer
# for each block allocated in the memory pool.

# Defines the coding policy to be used during indexing.
# Valid codings are 'rice', 'turbo-rice', 'pfor', 's9', 's16', 'vbyte', and 'null'.
# If modifying or adding new methods, remember to also make the changes in 'coding_methods.h'
#
# If the coding method is blockwise, that is, it encodes a block of integers at a time,
# additional options must be specified as part of the coding policy.
# Blockwise coding methods are: 'turbo-rice', and 'pfor'.
# The additional options that must be specified are the block size,
# the leftover coding method, and the minimum padding size.
# If we have less than the minimum padding size number of integers, 
# the leftover coding method will be used, otherwise the list of integers will
# be padded at the end until the block size with 0s. The leftover coding method
# should be a non-blockwise coding method.
# They should be specified in the following format:
# PrimaryCoding:BlockSize:LeftoverCoding:MinPaddingSize
#
# If the coding method is non-blockwise, it suffices to just specify the coding method.
# Non-blockwise coding methods are: 'rice', 's9', 's16', 'vbyte', and 'null'.

# Merging Parameters
